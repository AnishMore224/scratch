### PROBLEM
When we are viewing a website and suppose there is a link in it, there we click on it to move further but in place of getting the required page, a advertisement page gets opened and again we have to go back to our website page and click on the link again to get the required page.

### SOLUTION
So, to solve this we could block the advertisement page and let the user know about it by mentioning what we have blocked.

### EXAMPLE
Letâ€™s for example we are downloading a movie from a website so there a link is provided to generate the downloading link. When we press on it a new tab opens and it tells us to download an app but when we again return to our main website and click on the link, it provides us our download link. So, a user could get irritated by this website and he would not visit again the website. So, we could solve this problem and make the user to use the website smoothly without any issue. in order to do this, we could block the website to open and let the user get notified what it has blocked so if the user want to see that blocked page he/she could see it.
